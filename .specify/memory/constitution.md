# GOGS Cloud Infrastructure Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modularity & Maintainability
- Every feature MUST be implemented as a modular component.
- Favor composition over monolithic designs.
- Each module must have a single, clear responsibility.
- Module boundaries must be explicit and documented.
- Coupling between components must be minimized, cohesion must be maximized.
- All modules must expose clear public interfaces and hide internal complexity.
- Reusability across environments (dev, test, prod, cloud providers) is mandatory.
> Simplicity is a hard requirement. Over-engineering is a violation.

### II. Test Strategy & Quality Gates
A **strict testing pyramid** is enforced:
1. **Unit Tests**
    - Validate isolated logic and modules.
    - Must pass before integration work begins.
2. **Integration Tests**
    - Validate collaboration between components/modules.
    - Must pass before system-level testing begins.
3. **System / End-to-End Tests**
    - Validate full workflows across infrastructure and services.
    - Must pass before acceptance testing begins.
4. **Acceptance Tests**
    - Validate business and user-facing requirements.
    - Final gate for completion.
No implementation is considered complete unless it has passed:
> **Unit → Integration → System → Acceptance**
Skipping a level breaks the constitution.

### III. Refactoring & Continuous improvement
- After each successful test stage, the code **MUST be reviewed and refactored** to improve:
    - Modularity
    - Readability
    - Structure
    - Maintainability
- Refactoring **must not change system behavior**.
- Duplication, unclear abstractions, or unnecessary complexity **must be eliminated early**.
> Refactoring is not optional. It is part of the workflow, not an extra task.

### IV. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Principles
- Infrastructure must be:
    - Reproducible
    - Version-controlled
    - Idempotent
    - Cloud-agnostic when possible
- Environments must be **able to be created and destroyed from scratch** using code only.
- Variables, secrets, and environment configuration **must not be hard-coded**.

### V. CI/CD Pipeline
Pipelines must be:
    - Deterministic
    - Repeatable
    - Observable

### VI. Security by Design 
Security is not optional; it is part of the system’s definition.
- Follow the principle of **least privilege** everywhere (IAM, SSH, APIs, services).
- Secrets **MUST be managed through secure stores** (not in code).
- Every exposed interface must follow **secure defaults**:
    - Authentication required
    - Encryption enabled
    - Logging active
- All infrastructure must be auditable.
- Security scanning (code + IaC) **must be integrated into the pipeline**.
> If it is not secure by default, it violates the constitution.

### VII. AI-Assisted Development Rules
AI may be used to:
- Generate drafts of code, IaC, tests, documentation
- Detect patterns, errors, and optimization opportunities
- Propose improvements and refactors
But:
- AI output **must be reviewed by a human** before implementation
- AI cannot violate this constitution
- AI is an **assistant**, not the final authority
The constitution overrides AI suggestions.

### VIII. Clarity Principle
> **If a decision improves clarity, automation, security, and maintainability, it is aligned with this constitution.  
> If it increases ambiguity, coupling, or fragility, it is a violation.**
This constitution overrules preferences, shortcuts, and convenience.
